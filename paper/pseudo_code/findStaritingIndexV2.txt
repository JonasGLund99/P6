Input: Timestamps converted to ms since 1970: 
       timeStamps,
       average duration between events:
       duration
       Zones with constraints:
       searchIntervals,

Output: Intersecting events for each zone.

findStartingIndex(timeStamps, duration, searchInterval)
    start = searchInterval.start
    difference = start - timeStamps[0]
    estimatedIndex = floor(difference / averageTimegrowth)
    return binarySearch(timeStamps, start)
